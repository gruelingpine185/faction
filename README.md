# Faction

Faction is an FPS game inspired by my appreciation for low poly graphics and voxel art. This is my dream game. It is being build from the ground up, using Vulkan for rendering. 

## Cloning

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gruelingpine185/faction 
cd faction
```

## Building

Faction uses a Makefile for the building process. Just run

```sh
Make
```

and the resulting executable will be located in `./bin/`.

## Contributing
